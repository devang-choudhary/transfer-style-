# transfer-style-
Overview
This project implements style transfer using the VGG19 neural network to seamlessly blend the artistic style of one image with the content of another. The primary goal is to create a deep learning model capable of adapting an existing work to resemble the aesthetic of any chosen art.

Introduction
Style transfer involves extracting the artistic style from one image and applying it to another. In this project, we leverage the power of VGG19, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), to analyze the intricate details of an artistic style and transfer it to a new, original artwork.

How it Works
The VGG19 network is utilized as a feature extractor. By passing both the content and style images through the network, we can extract feature maps at different layers. The content loss measures the difference in content between the generated image and the target content image. The style loss, on the other hand, quantifies the difference in style between the generated image and the target style image. These losses are then minimized during the training process to create an image that encapsulates both the content and style characteristics
